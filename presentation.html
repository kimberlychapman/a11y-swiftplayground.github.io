		Utilizing Apple Technology to make Swift Playground more accessible to users who are blind; and to serve the larger goal of increasing inclusion through accessible technology.</div>

		<div class="owl--text">
		In this design, users trace the path on the tactile board, and then utilize iPad accessibility features to input their commands into their Swift Playground code.  The user continues to transition between exploring their path on the tactile board and revising their code on the Swift Playground App.</div>

		<div class="owl--text3">
		Many individuals who are blind use a white cane and/or a guide dog to help them move from place to place safely, and with greater independence.  When using these supports, individuals rely on sound and physical cues: the physical sensation that occurs when an individual's white cane makes contact with an object, or the physical cues one receives from their guide dog as they hold on to the guide dog's harness.  My goal was to create a design that allowed users who are blind to engage more with the iPad activities by using a tool that provides similar feedback to the feedback they receive while navigating their environment with a white cane and/or a guide dog.</div>
	</div>
  <div class="owl-slide4">
		<div class="owl--text3">
      As the user traces their path on the iPad, they receive audio feedback that lets them  know if they are charting the right course (ex. a walking sound) and signals when they have come across a particular feature (i.e. a gem or a portal).  If the user goes off of the course, either while they are tracing their route or running their code, they receive audio & haptic feedback: in a manner that is similar to what an individual might experience while using a white cane.  The user can then use this feedback to write/revise their code.
